Here's a shot of the Boxster at an ice cream stand near Carlise, Mass.&nbsp;
I will often take a drive at lunch instead of eating as driving satisfies
a different type of appetite.

<p>Here's me the day I picked up my Porsche Boxster from the dealership;
it was a beautiful Fall day (end of October 1998, about 60 degrees out
and sunny).&nbsp; (Sorry for the picture quality -- these were taken with
a non-digital camera and then scanned in and then shrunk, etc.)&nbsp; Only
after about a day did I notice the cover not properly installed on my driverside
rollbar hoop (I put it back on).&nbsp; I was quite happy this day.

<p>Still figuring out how to drive the car, I back out of the garage to
get to know the car and all its dash components.
