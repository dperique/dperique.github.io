Boxster Overview</font></font></font></b></center>

<br>&nbsp;
<p><br>
<p>Specs: 1999 Porsche Boxster (type 986), built in Valmet, Finland (9/98),
metallic black paint, graphite grey interior, sport touring package (includes
17" wheels, aluminum dials, brake handle, shifter, door sills, 6 CD changer,
hi fi stereo, painted Porsche crest on the wheels).
<p>These pictures were taken with a HP Photosmart Camera C20.
<p>Here's a pic of the Boxster in the Avici Systems, Inc. parking lot in
Billerica, MA.&nbsp; This was taken on December 6, 1998 -- one day before
one of our big development milestones.&nbsp; Lots of engineers showed up
at work on Sunday to finish up and meet the deadline which was the following
day.&nbsp; It was 70 degrees that day (yes, in December!).&nbsp; This pic
shows how big the backend is.

<p>Here's a sideview pic; notice my shadow on the lower left.

<p>Here's a picture of what the car looked like when I visited the dealer
(October 28 9am) -- the day before I took delivery.&nbsp; The workers were
prepping the car for delivery.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course I instantly was overjoyed
and couldn't believe it was my car.&nbsp; BTW, that's not me in the picture.

<p>I took some pics of the rear left suspension because it was so clean.

<p>This one was on a fall day at a place called "East Point", Merrimack,
NH.

<p>I took the cabriolet top down to nicely expose the silver painted rollbars.&nbsp;
You can also see the center exhaust pipe which sports the extended metal
pipe.&nbsp; The nice foliage in the background added some nice color to
the photo.

<p>It's a good thing the car was only a few days old because the front
plate had not been put on -- and that's not legal in NH.

<p>After my first week of research, I got hold of some information about
cleaning the Boxster -- this included removing all of the wheels and cleaning
the inside of the rims.&nbsp;&nbsp; What a pleasure to view such pristine
cleanliness.

<p>This is the Colgan bra I use; notice that the top third of it that fits
on the hood can be removed so that the car doesn't look too much like it
has a bra on it.&nbsp; I put it on here just to try it out.
<center><img SRC="bra1.jpg" height=293 width=389></center>

<p>Here's where I removed the top third of it off -- exposing the badge
and making it less evident that there is a bra present.&nbsp; Note how
the bra actually traces the lines of the Boxster front end.&nbsp; My ex-boss's
M Roadster is nearby

<br><b><font size=+1>Information About the Speedometer</font></b></center>

<p>I have observed that Boxsters' speedometers have been known to be inaccurate.&nbsp;
I have obtained the following data and have built the following <a href="bxt.xls">spreadsheet
</a>and
graph to see if there is anything interesting to observe about the level
of error as a function of speed -- actually, mostly because if I want to
brag to my friends about how fast I have gone in a Boxster, I'd hate to
tell them that the speedometer is off by x percent and so I really wasn't
going that fast, etc.
<p>So here's the graph below. If any Boxster drivers have data at the high
end speed ranges, please let me know (i.e., send me email with your data
and I will update the graph as appropriate).
<p>Note the negative slope (i.e., as speed increases, percent error drops).&nbsp;
Maybe at high speeds, the error is very low which means that I can brag
about high speed and still know that I really when that fast ;-)

<p>Note: I got most of the data from someone I corresponded with from <a href="http://www.boxster.org">Porsche
Pete's Boxster Board</a> ; he prefers to remain anonymous -- but I thank
him just the same (as he seemed to live on the edge when taking the measurements
-- pun intended).
