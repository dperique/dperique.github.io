<BR>This page contains sounds the Boxster makes (i.e., engine noises).&nbsp;
The sound of the Boxster is exquisit; I think lots of the fun derived from
driving can be attributed to the way the engine sounds.&nbsp; Specifically,
the best noises are at 4200 RPMs and 5200 RPMs.&nbsp; The sound clip below
makes an attempt to let users hear these sounds.

<P>I taped the sounds by placing a mini cassette recorder between the passenger
seat and armrest -- recorder&nbsp; facing up; since the engine is behind
the passengers, I felt this would give the best sound.&nbsp; The cab top
was closed and I was in 5:30pm traffic up I93 North and had a chance to
make/hear engine noises for brief intervals.

<P>At 10.5 seconds into the recording, you will hear 4200 RPMs at which
point I shifted into 3rd.&nbsp; At around 27 seconds, you will hear the
pitch of the 5200 RPMs sound.&nbsp; I believe this recording gives a good
idea of the sound but I don't feel it does it justice.

<P>I apologize for the sound quality -- it's the best I could do with my
primitive equipment.
