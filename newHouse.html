<p>The above was taken in the late fall; at the time, we were looking into 
  buying the house (i.e., it was not ours yet). </p>

<p>The above was taken June 1, 2001 (view from the street).&nbsp; We finally 
  get to really enjoy the house now that the nice weather is here in NH.&nbsp; 
  I believe this was taken in the morning when the sun shines to the left 
of the house. </p>

<p>The above shows the driveway from the view of the mailbox.&nbsp; It's a
nice long driveway but requires some effort when the snow piles on it. </p>

     This is the front sidewalk area leading to the front door. &nbsp;We
just   had new mulch put down.<br>

<p>Above is a view from the rear.&nbsp; Note the nice big windowed area to
  the right.&nbsp; This gives us lots of light in the eat-in kitchen -- one
  of my favorite features. </p>

<p>The above two pictures show views of the dining room from the living room.&nbsp;
 Both  rooms flow as a single room but are separated via the pillars on either 
 side.  </p>

<p>Here's the view from the eat-in area off of the kitchen.&nbsp; During winter,
there is some nice scenery to take in while having breakfast. </p>
       
<p>Here are the specifications: Colonial style with 3 car garage, 4000 sq
  ft., 3.5 baths, 4 bedroom, rec room, downstairs office, alarm system, central
  vac, hardwood floors downstairs, carpet upstairs, all on 2.29 acres of
land.     &nbsp; </p>
