<p>2001 - 2002: <i>Snowshore Networks, Inc.: </i>Principal SQA Engineer </p>
<ul>
SQA testing of Snowshore's N20 and A1 Media Servers (a Media Server is a
key infrastructure component for Voice over IP) 
  <p><b>Accomplishments/Responsibilities:</b> </p>
  <ul>
 <li> Development, implementation, and execution of testplans for:</li>
  
    <ul>
 <li> SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) signaling: includes the development
of a SIP client simulator for simulating thousands of SIP clients for stress 
testing (in terms of calls per second, and number of calls) of the Snowshore 
N20 media server; the SIP state machine was user configurable so that he/she 
could simulate various behavior of a "misbehaving" SIP client.</li>
  <li> MGCP (Media Gateway Control Protocol) signaling: includes development
of MGCP client simulator used for unit testing of MGCP</li>
  <li> Security/denial-of-service testing (e.g., ping of death, ping storm,
TCP SYN attack, etc.): includes developing utilities for creating these networking 
simulations (e.g., send fragments of ICMP packets with incorrect offsets to
make the IP stack think it received an IP packet that was legal when, in
fact, it was too big -- thus causing a crash)</li>
  <li> SNMP, and IP/Networking testing: this testing involved using Scotty
SNMP client software and performing various SNMP set, get, getnext, getbulk, 
etc. queries.&nbsp; Wrote utilities for sending ARP, ICMP, RIP, OSPF, TCP 
packets to the device under test in a highly controlled way to confirm correct
functionality of routing table, ARP table and correctly ignoring certain
packets.</li>
 
    </ul>
 
  </ul>
  
  <ul>
 <li> Wrote many test scripts and tools (still in use today)</li>
  
    <ul>
 <li> For software developers I wrote scripts to simulate a variable number
of SIP clients (from 1 to 500) with variable SIP settings/parameters to help 
developers reproduce and debug scaling software problems.</li>
  <li> For the SQA team I wrote scripts used to perform scaling tests that
last for days/weeks; the scripts would setup calls and conferences that started 
and terminated repeatedly at high speed until it was stopped; the purpose 
was to test how long the N20 could continue to operate under high stress conditions.</li>
 
    </ul>

 1999 - 2001: <i>River Delta Networks, Inc.: </i>Principal Software Engineer. 
<blockquote>Developed <a
 href="http://home.attbi.com/%7Edperique/AUsersGuide.html">Network Protocol
Simulation Tool (NetPST)</a> 
  <p>NetPST consists of 43,662 lines of C/C++ &amp; 20,678 of tcl/tk scripting.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
When writing/designing NetPST, I used object oriented design to facilitate 
easy and rapid modification and addition of new network simulations. </p>
  <p>The technique used in the NetPST for developing the packet encoders/decoders 
is in the process of being patented (starting with provisional patent).&nbsp; 
This technique is special in that it allows one to add encoders/decoders for
protocol fragments very quickly.</p>
</blockquote>
  
<blockquote>This software is used by development and SQA extensively for unit
testing, scaling testing, regression testing and debugging of River Delta
Networks' software.&nbsp; It can analyze protocols for over 500 different 
fragment types &amp; serves as a platform for developing high speed simulations 
for routing protocols.&nbsp; It includes the ability to model protocol FSM
(Finite State Machine) behavior, encode and decode protocol data traffic, 
and manage automated test scripts.</blockquote>
  
<blockquote><b>Accomplishments/Responsibilities:</b></blockquote>
  
<blockquote> 
  <ul>
 <li> All design/development/documentation/training for NetPST</li>
  <li> SQA consulting for application of NetPST including test development
and automation</li>
  <li> SQA consulting for development of test plans</li>
  <li> Wrote automated test scripts for testing routing protocol behavior
(these scripts serve as examples and training aids for future script development)</li>
  <li> Development of a large set of routing protocol simulations based on
the NetPST technology.&nbsp; Any simulations that required high speed were 
optimized at the C/C++ level for maximum efficiency.</li>
  <li> Development of the "Packet Relay" software for relaying packets from
an Ethernet device to a Sonet device over a UDP connection between a PC and 
a Sonet board.&nbsp; This software (written in C for use with VxWorks) used
my "Packet Relay" software framework to transform a vendor board into a "Packet
Relay" device and works in conjunction with NetPST.</li>
  <li> Created protocol encoders/decoders for the DOCSIS BPI and BPI+ protocol 
fragments that helped the CMTS development team test, debug, and prepare for
DOCSIS 1.0 and 1.1 certification.&nbsp; Spent time working with CMTS development
team and successfully convinced them to use the NetPST; the result was a
significant increase in productivity with respect to testing, debugging,
and troubleshooting.</li>
  <li> Created protocol encoders/decoders for numerous networking protocols
per RFCs and drafts</li>
  <li> Created several protocol simulations per RFCs; this includes using
the protocol decoders/encoders with FSMs.</li>
 
  </ul>
 </blockquote>
  
<blockquote><b>Simulations:</b></blockquote>
  
<blockquote> 
  <ul>
 <li> ARP, RIPv1 &amp; v2, OSPFv2 (both master &amp; slave), BGP4, ISIS L1/L2, 
RSVP, IGMP over Ethernet</li>
  <li> PPP LCP &amp; IPCP over Sonet for PPP positive and negative testing</li>
  <li> Large number of BGP4 (500+ BGP4 neighbors, 1.2+ million routes) &amp;
OSPFv2 (100 OSPFv2 peers and 12000 LSAs) simulators for scaling tests; some
scaling work for RIPv1 &amp; v2 and ISIS.</li>
  <li> Multiple DHCP clients on single Ethernet connected to cable modem
on other side of CMTS</li>
 
  </ul>
 </blockquote>
 1997 - 1999:<i> Avici Systems, Inc.</i>: Principal Software Engineer 
<blockquote>Designed and developed NUTcracker (Avici's core tool for testing 
its Terabit Switch Router (TSR) including routing protocol conformance and
performance measurements (e.g., line rate packet forwarding)). This tool
is: used by software team to allow them to test scaling modifications made
to Gated, reproduce routing protocol bugs; used by SQA team to write all
of their automated tests (approx. 1100 individual tests for ISIS, RIP, OSPF,
BGP4, SNMP, ICMP, PPP, MPLS); used by SQA to test for line rate forwarding 
at OC3, OC12, and OC48 speeds; used by ASIC engineering to send line rate 
Sonet traffic to test the TSR ASICs (including fabric testing); used by Avici
customers to verify that the TSR is working to their satisfaction before
they deploy it in their network; used as a sales and demo tool so that Avici
can demonstrate the TSR's capabilities and exploit the weaknesses of competitors
(e.g., Cisco).&nbsp; The is two parts of software: one that runs on a UNIX
workstation and the other on a TSR module running VxWorks. 
  <p>My work has two patents in processing: Large Internet Simulator, Packet 
Engine and Packet API. <br>
Final assignment at Avici included MPLS, RSVP packet analysis/monitoring, 
ATM cell analysis/monitoring (segmentation/reassembly). </p>
  <p><b>Accomplishments/Responsibilities:</b> </p>
  <ul>
 <li> Design, development, documentation, training of the NUTcracker project; 
developed entire product; 32,000 lines of C++ code,&nbsp; 15,000 lines of
object oriented tcl code</li>
  <li> Evaluating/(buying if appropriate) other vendors' tools for protocol
testing and simulation.</li>
  <li> Recommendations on machines for running tests.</li>
  <li> Consulting for SQA and software teams for equipment requirements.</li>
  <li> Consulting for SQA organization, software team, customers in how to
use NUTcracker for stress testing and creating more complex protocol conformance 
tests.</li>
  <li> Demos and training to customers, company partners, etc.</li>
 
  </ul>
 <b>Applications written:</b> 
  <ul>
 <li> Packet Monitor and decoder that runs on Ethernet, PPP over Sonet, V.35, 
TCP sockets, UDP sockets, UNIX files.&nbsp; Decodes packets using my packet 
libraries that have an API for allowing a programmer to define any packet 
data format (packet formats I programmed include: Ethernet, PPP, RIP, OSPF, 
BGP4, ISIS, SNMP, ICMP, IP/TCP/UDP and options, etc.&nbsp; The Packet Monitor 
has a GUI with point and click functionality for examining/analyzing network 
traffic.&nbsp; Patent work is in progress for my Packet engine and PacketAPI.</li>
  <li> BGP4 Peer router engine: this is a BGP4 implementation designed to
simulate up to 250 BGP routers on a single Ethernet interface and send and
receive large amounts of BGP route updates (e.g., 500,000 routes); it was
used for testing the limits of Gated before and after Avici made scaling
modifications to it.&nbsp; Patent work is in process for this technology.</li>
  <li> Framework for creating protocol finite state machines (FSM): this
is a library of functions callable from an interpreted scripting language
that allows one to easily look at a typical RFC and translate the FSM into
a working program that can simulate the particular protocol; functionality 
included the ability to make asynchronous calls to action functions and send/receive
packets as the function calls are made.</li>
  <li> TestManager Graphical Interface: this application allowed a test writer 
to automated their network protocol conformance test scripts; the application 
included a graph of pass/fail/abort tests, point/click interface for choosing 
tests, framework for creating, running, and cleaning up after tests, etc.</li>
  <li> Graphical Packet Composer: this application provided a point/click
interface for creating a packet using my packet database; e.g., a user can
create a valid BGP4 routing packet by blindly clicking on a GUI; users can
set fields to different values using the GUI and display their packet in
a graphical way so they can tell if it is composed the way they want it to 
be.</li>
  <li> High Speed Sonet Packet Generator: this application was written on
VxWorks and using the Avici TSR ASIC drivers to send packets at line rate
to a Sonet device under test.&nbsp; Packets were composed using the Graphical 
Packet Composer and downloaded to the TSR module and stored in memory after 
which they were sent repeatedly to the device under test.&nbsp; Packet traffic
patterns were designed for full mesh testing, multiport to single port, and
single port to port testing.&nbsp; Worked closely with ASCI driver development
team to integrate any driver enhancements that caused packet generation speed
to be faster and/or more efficient.</li>
