<h1><b> Linux on the Toshiba Satellite A45S150 Laptop</b></h1>
 <br>
 I recently bought a Toshiba Satellite A45S150 and installed Linux on it (spent
a few weeks off and on and a little frustration searching and finding, drinking
coffee, etc.)<br>
 <br>
 I didn't see anything for Linux out there on the A45S150 and thought I'd 
contribute since I got almost everything (the basics) working.&nbsp; I suggest
sitting down (hopefully wireless is working on your WinXP setup and you can
read this on a comfortable couch) and reading this all the way through to
save any frustration/problems I may have already solved.<br>
 <br>
 Take some time to figure out your partition scheme and what you want to do
with Linux and/or which distribution you want to use.&nbsp; Note I got just
the "basics" working (i.e., enough to setup Linux for web-surfing and C/C++
software development from the couch via wireless).<br>
 <br>
 Feel free to email me (dperique@yahoo.com) with comments and/or suggestions
(which I may or may not implement -- I have a day job that really takes up
most of my days (and nights sometimes)).<br>
 <br>
 The Toshiba Satellite A45S150 comes with the following configuration (and
then some):<br>
 
<ul>
   <li>Pentium 4 2.4Ghz<br>
   </li>
   <li>60G disk (one partition) for WinXP Home<br>
   </li>
   <li>512M RAM</li>
   <li>10/100 Ethernet (wired), 802.11g (54M) wireless (802.11b compatible)</li>
   <li>Intel 82852/82855 GM/GME Graphics controller (32M RAM) 1024x768</li>
   <li>SoundMax Integrated Digital Audio (i8xxx)</li>
   <li>USB 2.0 x 4; TV out (s-video)</li>
   <li>etc. (see advertisements from complete list)<br>
   </li>
 
</ul>
 Here's what I setup and found out:<br>
 
<ul>
   <li>My partition scheme</li>
   
  <ul>
     <li>Bought Partition Magic 8.0 from BestBuy via download for ~$50</li>
     <li>Chop up the 60G partition as follows</li>
     
    <ul>
       <li>25G WinXP (primary NTFS)<br>
       </li>
       <li>33.5G Extended</li>
       
      <ul>
         <li>500M FAT32 for sharing between Linux and WinXP</li>
         <li>8.2G ext3 for the root partition (mounted as /)<br>
         </li>
         <li>2.0G ext3 for user files (mounted as /home)</li>
         <li>522M swap (this laptop comes stock with 512M RAM)</li>
         <li>22.2G NTFS for my WinXP data</li>
       
      </ul>
     
    </ul>
     <li>Note that I have /home on a separate partition; this was so I can
install/reinstall Linux (during my experimental stage) without having to
blow away my user data.</li>
     <li>I left enough space on WinXP for applications and data and created
500M of FAT32 so I can share files between WinXP and Linux since NTFS support
on Linux is read-only.</li>
   
  </ul>
 
</ul>
 
<ul>
   <li>Dual boot information<br>
   </li>
   
  <ul>
     <li>I use lilo on the first partition /dev/hda1</li>
     <li>I tried grub on Redhat 8.0 and it worked but I don't know much about
it<br>
     </li>
   
  </ul>
 
</ul>
 
<ul>
   <li>Redhat 8.0 (I installed it because I had the CDs laying around)<br>
   </li>
   
  <ul>
     <li>Sound card works after using redhat-configsoundcard</li>
     <li>XFree86 does not work because you need XFree86 4.3 (RH8.0 uses 4.2)</li>
     <li>10/100 Ethernet (onboard) is recognized and works just fine</li>
     <li>Atheros 802.11g wireless (onboard) is not recognized</li>
     <li>You can rebuild the kernel and get NTFS support and it works (readonly)</li>
   
  </ul>
 
</ul>
 
<ul>
   <li>Mandrake 9.1 Standard (was hoping this would work)<br>
   </li>
   
  <ul>
     <li>Bought from MandrakeSoft for about $33<br>
     </li>
     <li>Sound card worked</li>
     <li>XFree86 worked (Mandrake 9.1 comes with XFree86 4.3)</li>
     <li>10/100 Ethernet (onboard) worked</li>
     <li>Atheros 802.11g wireless (onboard) is not recognized</li>
     <li>Could not find gcc or kernel so I could do nothing here</li>
   
  </ul>
 
</ul>
 
<ul>
   <li>Redhat 9.0 (finally settled on this distribution)<br>
   </li>
   
  <ul>
     <li>Bought the CDs from getlinuxcds.com for about $9</li>
     <li>Sound card works after using redhat-configsoundcard</li>
     <li>XFree86 works (RH9.0 comes with XFree86 4.3; note that I had to run
redhat-config-xfree86 and restart X (before I did that I got some fuzzy lines
on the screen and felt I was somehow frying the screen); upon a later reboot,
I could see on the boot messages that Linux was recognizing my graphics card.&nbsp;
I use the touchpad or a USB wheel mouse; the switch, you must use redhat-config-mouse
and restart X.<br>
     </li>
     <li>10/100 Ethernet (onboard) is recognized and works just fine</li>
     <li>Atheros 802.11g wireless (onboard) is not recognized; you have to
go to the "madwifi" site (do a google search) and get the drivers.&nbsp;
I did an anonymous CVS checkout and built it; read the faq.&nbsp; Once built
and loaded the 802.11g was found and came up with no problems (note that
you need sharutils to get the ath_hal.o to work; I used sharutils-4.2.tar.gz)<br>
     </li>
     <li>You can rebuild the kernel and get NTFS support and it works (readonly).</li>
   
  </ul>
 
</ul>
 
<ul>
   <li>Other:</li>
   
  <ul>
     <li>I have an old (1 year) 802.11b Linksys card for PCMCIA.&nbsp; I had
to use pcmcia 3.2.7 to get it to work:</li>
     
    <ul>
       <li>Download pcmcia 3.2.7</li>
       <li>cd /usr/local ; tar xzf pcmcia-3.2.7.tar.gz</li>
       <li>do a 'make' (I took all defaults when asked questions)<br>
       </li>
       <li>do a 'make install'</li>
       <li>do /etc/rc.d/init.d/pcmcia restart (to restart PCMCIA services)</li>
       <li>do 'tail -f /var/log/messages'</li>
       <li>Create and/or modify /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
or something like that; I set it to DHCP<br>
       </li>
       <li>insert the card (hopefully hear two high pitched beeps and see
messages that look good)</li>
     
    </ul>
     <li>Useful commands on Redhat</li>
     
    <ul>
       <li>redhat-config-packages</li>
       <li>redhat-config-sound</li>
       <li>redhat-config-time</li>
       <li>redhat-config services (e.g. so you can turn on FTP)</li>
       <li>redhat-config-securitylevel</li>
     
    </ul>
     <li>Turn on some useful services</li>
     
    <ul>
       <li>In /etc/xinet.d/telnet (set disable to no)</li>
       <li>In /etc/xinet.d/vxftp (set disable to no)</li>
       <li>/etc/rc.d/init.d/xinetd restart (to restart inet daemon)</li>
     
    </ul>
     <li>Note that if you want to build a kernel, start with the config in
/boot called config-2.14-18 (in RH 8.0) so that you can only slightly modify
your stock RH kernel (i.e., minimize chances of messing up something that
already works).</li>
     <li>Here's what I do for the Atheros 802.11g setup:</li>
     
    <ul>
       <li>cd /usr/local</li>
       <li>tar xzf madwifi.tar</li>
       <li>install sharutils or do 'alias uudecode="perl uudecode.pl"')</li>
       <li>cd ./madwifi</li>
       <li>make (make sure there are no errors on the build)<br>
       </li>
       <li>insmod wlan/wlan.o</li>
       <li>insmod ath_hal/ath_hal.o</li>
       <li>insmod driver/ath_pci.o</li>
       <li>make install (puts the .o files in /lib/modules...)</li>
       <li>ifup ath0 up (after you created /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ath0)</li>
       <li>iwpriv ath0 mode 3 (lock opertion to 11g (54M)</li>
       <li>See the madwife README for more tools/information<br>
       </li>
     
    </ul>
   
  </ul>
 
</ul>
 
<ul>
   <li>I did not get the APM stuff to work.&nbsp; I get "apm: BIOS not found"
during bootup. &nbsp; I'd appreciate any help with this.&nbsp; I just want
to extend the life of a battery charge (automatically shutoff disks, show
me how much charge I have left, etc.) and be able to turn off the laptop
without having to press the power button).</li>
