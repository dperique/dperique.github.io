<h1><b>Piano Information</b><br>
</h1>
I've been studying piano starting July 7, 2001. &nbsp;I've practiced
quite regularly (i.e., everyday) since (except when there wasn't a
piano/keyboard present -- even then I would think about it and perhaps
practice in my head).<br>
<br>
I started reading books and working through a video/book self taught
course for 8 months. &nbsp;I learned how to read the notes on the grand
staff, chords, etc. &nbsp;I wasn't proficient at it and my tone was
really bad but at least I had a reasonable working knowledge of music.
At this
point, I figured the best way to proceed would be lessons 1 day
&nbsp;(1
hour each day) per week which I did for about 4 months (my instructor
and
I went through Alfred's Book I and II in order of pages -- didn't
complete
II). &nbsp;I then took two months off of lessons and then restarted.
&nbsp;I've
been taking lessons 1 day (1/2 hour) per week ever since.<br>
<br>
I stopped going through the Alfred's Books in order but refer to them
from time to time to pick up info on music theory and perhaps songs
that relate. &nbsp;I spend most of my time looking for songs that I
want to play; I learn , from each song, skills that I feel will make me
a better player. &nbsp;On a weekly basis I assess and figure out what
skill I need to work on and then look for music to match and/or make up
exercises.
&nbsp;I also listen to my instructor for advice and what things he
thinks
I should work on.<br>
<br>
I keep this repertoire list around for my own sanity and to help me
show how far I've come especially when I find myself having a difficult
time playing a new piece. &nbsp;In my list below, the composer is given
when known. &nbsp;In some cases, the composer is not given; instead I
indicate someone who has performed the song, or I give the reference
for the (sheet) music that I used. &nbsp;The names of each piece are
given; if the work "Easy" appears, this is a music arrangement geared
toward early piano players (I find that "Easy" is a relative term).
&nbsp;If "Easy" does not appear, the piece is the original
arrangement-- and NOT "Easy".<br>
<br>
There are numerous songs that I practice "when I feel in the mood" that
I don't list here because I never really seriously learned them.
&nbsp;These are songs that were meant for me to practice my sight
reading
and I actually don't want to memorize them because then I could no
longer
use them to practice sight reading anymore.<br>
<br>
Below I includ links to some of my more "listenable" pieces.&nbsp; I
recorded these on my electronic keyboard (fullsize GEM RP7) and then
encoded them using mp3.&nbsp; I tried to get them all in 1 or 2
"takes"; I did not obssess over them and repeat and splice, etc.&nbsp;
They are all played as is.&nbsp; Please forgive any mistakes (cut me
some slack as I'm just finishing my third year).&nbsp; These mp3s are
part of my mp3 album entitled (appropriately I might add) "Humbly
Me".&nbsp; Some pieces are not complete as I am still developing my
concentration and endurance at the piano.&nbsp; Above all, enjoy!<br>
<br>
Note: I have more but due to limited space offerred by my provider, I
can only put so much.<br>

<h2>Review of the Yamaha GP-1 (from a junior pianist)</h2>
I'm writing this review for those seeking a grand piano but
have little or no knowledge. &nbsp;I encourage you to look for other
resources on the net to get familiar with these beautiful instruments
and shop around and have fun. &nbsp;I sort of regret not really
shopping around. &nbsp;I think this is because I just didn't know what
to look for or how to play. On my next piano purchase, you can bet I
will be more equipped to shop and will play as many pianos as possible
before buying. &nbsp;Now that I know kind of what I'm doing, it's very
interesting to experience the various tones that different pianos make.<br>
<br>
You can look up specs for the GP1 and the Yamaha web site so I won't
detail them here.<br>
<br>
I bought this piano as my first real piano. &nbsp;I have a nice (i.e.,
formal) living room so I was concerned about looks. &nbsp;I didn't know
much about piano brands but knew the Yamaha name. &nbsp;I saw that
Sarah McLachlan was playing a Yamaha in her Mirror Ball video so that's
what I wanted.<br>
<br>
First of all, the piano is very "bright" sounding. &nbsp;In the
beginning, I liked this characteristic a lot. &nbsp;Now, I find it a
little annoying. &nbsp;I find myself using the una corda pedal a lot to
get the mellow sound I really want. &nbsp;I've played Kawaii pianos and
love their mellowness over the Yamaha. &nbsp;I had someone come and
"voice" the piano and that has helped a lot but I think the piano has
gotten back some of that brightness over time.<br>
<br>
The finish is beautiful but is easily scratched when cleaning with a
vacuum cleaner attachment. &nbsp;I use a soft dust cloth from now on.<br>
<br>
My home has central air and heat and the humidity stays near 50% all
the time and so the piano holds the tune really well. &nbsp;I've
noticed that at night (on cold nights outside), the piano sounds more
mellow. &nbsp;Perhaps because it's colder, etc. and that affects the
wood. &nbsp;It is at these times I am very drawn to the piano to play.<br>
<br>
The touch is nice but firm. &nbsp;Playing pianissimo is a challenge
(perhaps this will get better with experience). &nbsp;At night when the
piano is more mellow, it is such a pleasure to play. &nbsp;I believe it
has gotten better over time. &nbsp;It is just over a year old now.<br>
<br>
I've recently discovered a few different ways to play the piano (and
get
different sounds). &nbsp;These have allowed me to experience a
"newness"
about the piano (e.g., discovering something I didn't know about the
piano)
and have made owning the piano more exciting (esp. after the initial
excitement
of a new piano wore off):<br>
<ul>
  <li>Play with lid down and music holder up (standard way to play)</li>
  <li>Play with lid up and music holder up (makes a louder and fuller
sound)</li>
  <li>Play with lid up and music holder down (makes a louder and
clearer
sound (my favorite))</li>
  <li>Play with lid up and music holder piece removed so you can see
the
hammers (also louder and more clean but not as nice a sound as with
music
holder piece on (my opinion of course)</li>
</ul>
Also, playing with the una chorda pedal down has created interesting
effects
of sound. &nbsp;Moonlight Sonata (Op. 27, No. 2, 1st movement) sounds
spectacular when
played
with the lid up, music holder down and una chorda pedal used. &nbsp;Of
course
"spectacular" is relative given that I haven't played that long<br>
