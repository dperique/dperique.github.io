<p>This section contains information about my 2001 Audi S4.&nbsp; Please
enjoy.
<p>The pictures are taken the day I picked up the car.&nbsp; I have to
admit that this car was not as exciting to pick up as my Boxster was.
<p>This Audi is Santorin Blue exterior, Onyx interior, Bose speakers, cold-weather
package.&nbsp; It has a 2.7 V6, twin turbo that puts out 258 ft/lbs of
torque @ 1850 rpms and 250hp.&nbsp; The wheels are 17" Avus rims with 225/45
Pirelli P6000s (winter tires are same size bug Dunlop M2 WinterSport SP).

I purchased my 2001 Audi S4 December 5th, 2000.&nbsp; It replaced a 1996
Toyota Camry LEV6.&nbsp; The Camry thus far has been my workhorse (potent,
reliable, and trouble free).&nbsp; I really needed a daily driver that
was fun to drive as I had major withdrawals when the winter came and I
had to put the Porsche Boxster away.
<p>One cool thing about the S4 is that the doors open really wide.&nbsp;
There are three positions and below is the widest position.

<p>My favorite part about the car is the engine -- it looks good and has
lots of torque.&nbsp; I haven't stalled the car yet and probably never
will; there is so much torque it's actually hard to stall it.&nbsp; All
that nice torque makes for quick takeoffs and plenty of power for oversteer
recovery.&nbsp; It also makes for low gas mileage (at least for a daily
driver/commuter) as I've been getting about 20mpg.

<p>The interior is nice.&nbsp; It has all the nice comforts one would want
in a luxury sedan.&nbsp; My favorites are the heated seats and stereo system.

<p>From the exterior, the car is very understated.&nbsp; It looks similar
to the lesser powered A4.&nbsp; But to the trained eye, you can easily
identify the S4.&nbsp; For example the backend has the S4 badging, the
wheels are 17" standard, and the front has six grill openings.

<p>Also note the big 17" Avus wheels.

<p>All in all, you will find that the owner is very happy with this car.

<p>Secondary owner is also very happy with it -- even as a backseater.
