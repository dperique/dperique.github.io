<blockquote>To install the NetPST, you will need (as a minimum):
  <blockquote> <li> Pentium II 300Mhz, 128M, 200M hd, 17" High Res
Color
Monitor, 1 or more Ethernet ports</li>
    <li> Redhat Linux 8.0, 9.0 with graphics card that supports X
windows</li>
    <li> Root privileges (for sending raw Ethernet packets)</li>
  </blockquote>
NetPST can be run on a smaller, less powerful machine but only the
above or better is supported.</blockquote>
<b><font size="+1">A Brief Description
of NetPST</font></b>
<blockquote>The Network Protocol Simulation Tool (NetPST) is a software
tool
designed for testing network protocols (with a specialty in Internet
routing
protocols).&nbsp; It is a tcl/tk interpreter enhanced with APIs and
libraries
that allow a user to simulate network protocols and configure network
devices.
  <p>NetPST is unique in its facilities for being able to write
automated test scripts for simulating different protocol behavior. </p>
  <p>The NetPST contains: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Off the shelf software components: tcl8.3, tk8.3, itcl3.1,
itk3.1,
expect5.31, libreadline-based CLI; NetPST can also be loaded as a tcl
package
using the tcl "package require" command.&nbsp; Information about tcl,
tk,
itcl, itk, expect, etc. is available at <a href="http://www.tcltk.com">www.tcltk.com.</a></li>
    <li> Network packet encoders/decoders for over 550 protocol
fragments.
Layer 2, routing, and multicast protocols: Ethernet, LLC, ARP, PPP,
LCP,
IPCP, RIPv1, RIPv2, OSPFv2, BGP4, IGMP, DVMRP, PIM, DHCP, SNMP, TFTP,
IP,
IP Options, TCP, TCP Options, ICMP, ISIS, Integrated ISIS, DOCSIS BPI
&amp; BPI+, MPLS, RSVP.</li>
    <li> Finite State Machine framework (including support for timers,
timeout
events, packet filters, packet events, named events) for sending and
receiving packets and building complex FSMs and protocol simulations</li>
    <li> Test Execution Manager for building, running, logging,
reporting pass/fail status for automated test scripts written in tcl</li>
    <ul>
      <li> Test template generator</li>
      <li> Test template generator for protocol test that uses an FSM</li>
      <li> All tests can send/receive packets using any Linux supported
Network
Interface Card (NIC)</li>
    </ul>
    <li> Realtime Monitoring and decoding for Ethernet and Sonet and
any other
Linux supported Network Interface Card (NIC)</li>
    <li> Ability to capture packets in Monitor, change fields, and
resend the
packets.</li>
    <li> Simulators for various routing protocols:</li>
    <ol>
      <li> BGP4 router simulator: simulate either one peer or multiple
peers all
on one Ethernet.&nbsp; This has been used to test the limits of carrier
class routers (e.g., Juniper) sending over 1 million NLRIs and
simulating over 250
BGP4 peers</li>
      <li> OSPF router simulator:&nbsp; simulate either one OSPF peer
or multiple peers all on one Ethernet.&nbsp; This has been used to test
scaling (e.g., over 100 OSPFv2 peers and over 30,000 routes in the
RUT's OSPF database all
running overnight)</li>
      <li> RIP router simulator for RIPv1 and RIPv2</li>
      <li> Multicast Testing</li>
      <ul>
        <li> IGMP speaker simulates a host that does IGMP Joins and
Leaves; you
can have multiple IGMP speakers running simultaneously</li>
        <li> DVMRP router simulator simulates DVMRP speaker that does
DVMRP probes, grafts, prunes, and report packets.</li>
        <li> MFlow for generating multiple multicast packet flows</li>
      </ul>
      <li> ARP simulator will allow one to simulate an Ethernet host
that answers ARP (used for testing packet forwarding and to answer ARP
request for simulated OSPF speakers).</li>
      <li> ISIS Simulator (under development)</li>
    </ol>
    <li> Online help</li>
    <ul>
      <li> Each object has its own help information</li>
      <li> Help on each command available at the Command Line</li>
      <li> Documentation available in HTML form</li>
    </ul>
    <li> Test Suites Written By Users of NetPST</li>
    <ol>
      <li> UNH IOL RIP suite (automated)</li>
      <li> UNH IOL BGP4 suite (automated)</li>
      <li> Some test cases for UNH IOL OSPF suite</li>
    </ol>
    <li> Documentation in the form of HTML pages and online help that
comes
with the software.</li>
  </ul>
All functionality that requires fast execution speed (e.g.,
encoding/decoding packets, running FSMs, etc.) is all written in
C/C++.&nbsp; Tcl/tk/itcl/itk serves as a front end for this
functionality.&nbsp; This gives you the flexibility
and simplicity of an interpreted scripting language plus the speed and
efficiency
of a compiled language.
  <p>NetPST has enough functionality to allow a user to write a full
implementation of a routing protocol using tcl scripting.&nbsp;
However, because the purpose of NetPST is for testing, you only need to
implement that small subset of
the routing protocol that is big enough to make a Device Under Test or
Router
Under Test (DUT or RUT) "think" that it is connected to a router
running
a full implementation of the routing protocol.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Each command described can be executed on the NetPST CLI
(Command Line Interface) or executed from within a test script.&nbsp;
It is recommended that you experiment with commands using the CLI until
you get them to work as needed and then incorporate them into a test
script.
  <p>Note that there are four primary areas of functionality and four
primary commands: NPktIface, NPacket, NFSM, and NTestMgr.&nbsp; These
are for creating: </p>
  <ol>
    <li> Packet Interfaces: Used to send/receive data in the form of
packets</li>
    <li> Packets: Used to get fields, modify fields, and display packet
information</li>
    <li> FSMs: Used to simulate complex protocol state machines</li>
    <li> Test Execution Manager: Used to automate running of test
scripts in
the form of test suites</li>
  </ol>
Each one starts with an "N" to distinguish it from the tcl built-in
commands.
  <p>NetPST was written and developed on Linux using gnu C/C++ tools.</p>
