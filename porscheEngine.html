The engine is hard to get at -- at least the first time you try; I've got
it down to taking about 2.5 minutes (on a good day).&nbsp; You have to
half way close the cab top and undue a few hand turned screws and remove
several pieces of hardware to get to it.&nbsp; Well one day, I decided
to do just that -- well, for a wintery day, it was great entertainment.
<p>Here's how I started. I opened the cab top about halfway and exposed
the engine compartment.&nbsp; Then started to unscrew all the pieces.&nbsp;
In this picture, you'll see that the pieces are already removed.
<p>Incidentally, this is the garage of my previous house.

<p>Here's a nice shot of the left side of the engine -- my left if I were
sitting in the driver's seat.&nbsp; Note the cleanliness.&nbsp; I hope
it stays this clean forever.

<p>Here's another picture except showing the right side and the cowling
around the engine.&nbsp; Lots of stuff crammed into that little compartment.
