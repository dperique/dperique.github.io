Here's my first baby. We went for a ride June 12, 1999 to Lake Massebessic
in NH.&nbsp; What a nice Spring day.&nbsp; Kathryn took a few moments to
take in the scenery and watch the ducks.

<p>Here's my second baby.&nbsp; We were off to work on a weekend morning
to catch up on some work for a company milestone.&nbsp; As you can imagine,
both babies keep me busy.

<p>Here's Kathryn and the Porsche basking in the sun after a wash.&nbsp;
The wipers are up just so I can clean the lower part of the windshield.

<p>Here's another "kid" -- this is our Dachsund Rudy.&nbsp; We call him
RooRoo, Booboo, poopHead (he earned this one because of the messes he leaves
outside), or whatever.&nbsp; Rudy likes to bury himself in a blanket and
poke his head out.&nbsp; It's rather cute and Rudy is quite intelligent
(as most Dachsunds are).

<p>This picture is adorable!&nbsp; Kathryn is giving her Mickey Mouse a
kiss.&nbsp; One of the early things she's learned to understand is "give
Mickey kiss!".&nbsp; This was taken March 27, 1999.

<p>Here's my wife Jule' after having gotten Kathryn dresses for going out.&nbsp;
This was taken April 26, 1999 -- a little over a week after I mailed my
taxes -- whew!

week or so after her birthday.
