<p>
  2003 - <span style=FONT-STYLE:italic>Present: Juniper Networks, Inc.:</span>
  Systems Integration and Test Engineer<br>
</p>
<div style=MARGIN-LEFT:40px>
  System Integration and Test (SIT) of Juniper ERX series (Edge) routers: Test
  SIT process was about testing software during the development cycle so that by
  the time we handed it to SQA, the software was already at good quality.&nbsp;
  This allowed SQA to focus on more intensive and high scaled testing.<br>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Developed extensive automation for running over 600 testcases on two
      builds on a weekly basis.&nbsp; These test cases ran 24x7 over eight
      different routers until complete.&nbsp; The output consisted of:
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Extensive logs detailing failures (which helped in triaging and failure
        analysis)
      </li>
      <li>
        Reports detailing pass/fail dates and test run history (so you determine
        when a test last passed to pinpoint where regressions were introduced)
      </li>
      <li>
        Bug reports which can be modified with detailed information as you
        investigated the bug cause; these same reports were fed into a bug
        reporting tool I wrote so you can automate entering bug reports into the
        Clearquest bug database.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      Introduced new testcases as needed; given my automation background, I
      could determine if special testcases were conducive to automation.&nbsp;
      In many cases, I would write both the test and the automation
      infrastructure.&nbsp; For example, I wrote a test harness to facilitate
      testing high availability (HA) functionality which involved running data
      traffic through the ERX router, simulating a crash, and confirming that
      data traffic still flowed.<br>
    </li>
    <li>
      Ran the tests weekly, processed the results and reported the results to
      the routing protocols group.
    </li>
    <li>
      Helped make decisions on the health of the release based on the results of
      the testing<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  System Integration and Test of Juniper M Series (Core) routers<br>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Developed Perl libraries to facilitate writing of testcases that were
      conducive to structured reporting and automation (the idea is to bring
      what I did for the ERX series SIT testing to the M series routers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Wrote testcases to demonstrate the libraries I wrote and to built up a set
      of System Integration Test scripts that can be run on a frequent basis to
      help gauge the stability of the daily builds.
    </li>
    <li>
      Setup demo for customer where there was DHCP server, DHCP client, IGMP
      clients, and video stream using our MX-960 routers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Deployed NetPST software to simulate DHCP server, DHCP client, IGMP
      clients, and video stream using a single Linux PC.&nbsp; Developers use
      NetPST to send test data traffic for debugging the Packet Forwarding
      Engine software at the unit test level.&nbsp; Eventually, the Multicast
      team intends to use it in their unit testing and for debugging their
      software.<br>
    </li>
    <li>
      Setup/connect, troubleshoot (rescue malfunctioning routers) for the group;
      troubleshoot buggy software.
    </li>
    <li>
      Incorporated Gigabit Ethernet over copper into our test systems (switched
      from Gigabit Ethernet over fiber) to save money by allowing us to buy
      10/100/1000 hubs as opposed to fiber switches ($50 vs. $2000).&nbsp; This
      introduced much more flexibility in our testing environment .&nbsp; For
      example, it allowed test PCs (e.g., running NetPST) to test Gigabit
      routers (as opposed to expensive fiber equipment); allowed us to connect
      100Mb ERX series routers to MX-960 routers for interoperability testing.
    </li>
    <li>
      Worked with Agilent Router Tester for testing DHCP Relay scaling to
      identify max number of clients and max number of DHCP clients per second;
      BGP scaling, IGMP scaling, data throughput testing.
    </li>

<p>
  2001 - 2002: <i>Snowshore Networks, Inc.: </i>Principal SQA Engineer
</p>
<ul>
  SQA testing of Snowshore's N20 and A1 Media Servers (a Media Server is a key
  infrastructure component for VOIP)
  <p>
    <b>Accomplishments/Responsibilities:</b>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Development, implementation, and execution of test-plans for:
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) signaling: includes the development of
        a SIP client simulator for simulating thousands of SIP clients for
        stress testing (in terms of calls per second, and number of calls) of
        the Snowshore N20 media server; the SIP state machine was user
        configurable so that he/she could simulate various behavior of a
        "misbehaving" SIP client.
      </li>
      <li>
        MGCP (Media Gateway Control Protocol) signaling: includes development of
        MGCP client simulator used for unit testing of MGCP
      </li>
      <li>
        Security/denial-of-service testing (e.g., ping of death, ping storm, TCP
        SYN attack, etc.): includes developing utilities for creating these
        networking simulations (e.g., send fragments of ICMP packets with
        incorrect offsets to make the IP stack think it received an IP packet
        that was legal when, in fact, it was too big -- thus causing a crash)
      </li>
      <li>
        SNMP, and IP/Networking testing: this testing involved using Scotty SNMP
        client software and performing various SNMP set, get, getnext, getbulk,
        etc. queries.&nbsp; Wrote utilities for sending ARP, ICMP, RIP, OSPF,
        TCP packets to the device under test in a highly controlled way to
        confirm correct functionality of routing table, ARP table and correctly
        ignoring certain packets.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Wrote many test scripts and tools (still in use today)
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For software developers I wrote scripts to simulate a variable number of
        SIP clients (from 1 to 500) with variable SIP settings/parameters to
        help developers reproduce and debug scaling software problems.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the SQA team I wrote scripts used to perform scaling tests that last
        for days/weeks; the scripts would setup calls and conferences that
        started and terminated repeatedly at high speed until it was stopped;
        the purpose was to test how long the N20 could continue to operate under
        high stress conditions.

1999 - 2001: <i>River Delta Networks, Inc.: </i>Principal Software Engineer.
<blockquote>Developed
<a href=http://home.attbi.com/%7Edperique/AUsersGuide.html#A%20Brief%20Description%20of%20NetPST>Network
Protocol Simulation Tool (NetPST)</a>
<p>
  NetPST consists of 43,662 lines of C/C++ &amp; 20,678 of tcl/tk
  scripting.&nbsp;&nbsp; When writing/designing NetPST, I used object oriented
  design to facilitate easy and rapid modification and addition of new network
  simulations.
</p>
<p>
  The technique used in the NetPST for developing the packet encoders/decoders
  is in the process of being patented (starting with provisional patent).&nbsp;
  This technique is special in that it allows one to add encoders/decoders for
  protocol fragments very quickly.
</p>
</blockquote> <blockquote>This software is used by development and SQA
extensively for unit testing, scaling testing, regression testing and debugging
of River Delta Networks' software.&nbsp; It can analyze protocols for over 500
different fragment types &amp; serves as a platform for developing high speed
simulations for routing protocols.&nbsp; It includes the ability to model
protocol FSM (Finite State Machine) behavior, encode and decode protocol data
traffic, and manage automated test scripts.</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Accomplishments/Responsibilities:</b></blockquote> <blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>
    All design/development/documentation/training for NetPST
  </li>
  <li>
    SQA consulting for application of NetPST including test development and
    automation
  </li>
  <li>
    SQA consulting for development of test plans
  </li>
  <li>
    Wrote automated test scripts for testing routing protocol behavior (these
    scripts serve as examples and training aids for future script development)
  </li>
  <li>
    Development of a large set of routing protocol simulations based on the
    NetPST technology.&nbsp; Any simulations that required high speed were
    optimized at the C/C++ level for maximum efficiency.
  </li>
  <li>
    Development of the "Packet Relay" software for relaying packets from an
    Ethernet device to a Sonet device over a UDP connection between a PC and a
    Sonet board.&nbsp; This software (written in C for use with VxWorks) used my
    "Packet Relay" software framework to transform a vendor board into a "Packet
    Relay" device and works in conjunction with NetPST.
  </li>
  <li>
    Created protocol encoders/decoders for the DOCSIS BPI and BPI+ protocol
    fragments that helped the CMTS development team test, debug, and prepare for
    DOCSIS 1.0 and 1.1 certification.&nbsp; Spent time working with CMTS
    development team and successfully convinced them to use the NetPST; the
    result was a significant increase in productivity with respect to testing,
    debugging, and troubleshooting.
  </li>
  <li>
    Created protocol encoders/decoders for numerous networking protocols per
    RFCs and drafts
  </li>
  <li>
    Created several protocol simulations per RFCs; this includes using the
    protocol decoders/encoders with FSMs.
  </li>

    work for RIPv1 &amp; v2 and ISIS.
  </li>
  <li>
    Multiple DHCP clients on single Ethernet connected to cable modem on other
    side of CMTS
  </li>
</ul>
</blockquote> 1997 - 1999:<i> Avici Systems, Inc.</i>: Principal Software
Engineer <blockquote>Designed and developed NUTcracker (Avici's core tool for
testing its Terabit Switch Router (TSR) including routing protocol conformance
and performance measurements (e.g., line rate packet forwarding)). This tool is:
used by software team to allow them to test scaling modifications made to Gated,
reproduce routing protocol bugs; used by SQA team to write all of their
automated tests (approx. 1100 individual tests for ISIS, RIP, OSPF, BGP4, SNMP,
ICMP, PPP, MPLS); used by SQA to test for line rate forwarding at OC3, OC12, and
OC48 speeds; used by ASIC engineering to send line rate Sonet traffic to test
the TSR ASICs (including fabric testing); used by Avici customers to verify that
the TSR is working to their satisfaction before they deploy it in their network;
used as a sales and demo tool so that Avici can demonstrate the TSR's
capabilities and exploit the weaknesses of competitors (e.g., Cisco).&nbsp; The
is two parts of software: one that runs on a UNIX workstation and the other on a
TSR module running VxWorks.
<p>
  My work has two patents in processing: Large Internet Simulator, Packet Engine
  and Packet API.<br>
  Final assignment at Avici included MPLS, RSVP packet analysis/monitoring, ATM
  cell analysis/monitoring (segmentation/reassembly).
</p>
<p>
  <b>Accomplishments/Responsibilities:</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Design, development, documentation, training of the NUTcracker project;
    developed entire product; 32,000 lines of C++ code,&nbsp; 15,000 lines of
    object oriented tcl code
  </li>
  <li>
    Evaluating/(buying if appropriate) other vendors' tools for protocol testing
    and simulation.

    NUTcracker for stress testing and creating more complex protocol conformance
    tests.
  </li>
  <li>
    Demos and training to customers, company partners, etc.
  </li>
</ul>
<b>Applications written:</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    Packet Monitor and decoder that runs on Ethernet, PPP over Sonet, V.35, TCP
    sockets, UDP sockets, UNIX files.&nbsp; Decodes packets using my packet
    libraries that have an API for allowing a programmer to define any packet
    data format (packet formats I programmed include: Ethernet, PPP, RIP, OSPF,
    BGP4, ISIS, SNMP, ICMP, IP/TCP/UDP and options, etc.&nbsp; The Packet
    Monitor has a GUI with point and click functionality for examining/analyzing
    network traffic.&nbsp; Patent work is in progress for my Packet engine and
    PacketAPI.
  </li>
  <li>
    BGP4 Peer router engine: this is a BGP4 implementation designed to simulate
    up to 250 BGP routers on a single Ethernet interface and send and receive
    large amounts of BGP route updates (e.g., 500,000 routes); it was used for
    testing the limits of Gated before and after Avici made scaling
    modifications to it.&nbsp; Patent work is in process for this technology.
  </li>
  <li>
    Framework for creating protocol finite state machines (FSM): this is a
    library of functions callable from an interpreted scripting language that
    allows one to easily look at a typical RFC and translate the FSM into a
    working program that can simulate the particular protocol; functionality
    included the ability to make asynchronous calls to action functions and
    send/receive packets as the function calls are made.
  </li>
  <li>
    TestManager Graphical Interface: this application allowed a test writer to
    automated their network protocol conformance test scripts; the application
    included a graph of pass/fail/abort tests, point/click interface for
    choosing tests, framework for creating, running, and cleaning up after
    tests, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Graphical Packet Composer: this application provided a point/click interface
    for creating a packet using my packet database; e.g., a user can create a
    valid BGP4 routing packet by blindly clicking on a GUI; users can set fields
    to different values using the GUI and display their packet in a graphical
    way so they can tell if it is composed the way they want it to be.
  </li>
  <li>
    High Speed Sonet Packet Generator: this application was written on VxWorks
    and using the Avici TSR ASIC drivers to send packets at line rate to a Sonet
    device under test.&nbsp; Packets were composed using the Graphical Packet
    Composer and downloaded to the TSR module and stored in memory after which
    they were sent repeatedly to the device under test.&nbsp; Packet traffic
    patterns were designed for full mesh testing, multi-port to single port, and
    single port to port testing.&nbsp; Worked closely with ASIC driver
    development team to integrate any driver enhancements that caused packet
    generation speed to be faster and/or more efficient.

  Bay Networks routers for packet capture and packet filtering and live network
  packet captures) from UNIX to Windows NT/95 platform (e.g., Berkeley sockets
  to Winsock, etc.).
</li>
<li>
  Worked with Product Management to distribute Windows version of PCAP as
  Netscape plug-in and standalone utility to existing Bay Networks customers,
  customer support, and network professional services.

  of some of these protocols for flexible simulation purposes.&nbsp; Bay
  software development used my VLAN traffic simulator with their router
  simulator and resulted in reducing development time by several months.
</p>
</blockquote> <blockquote><b>Accomplishments:</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    Developed network description language (NDL) used to describe network
    topologies, simulated network nodes running various LAN protocols, and how
    they relate so test management software can create the networking simulation
    (composed of real and simulated hardware) as appropriate to allow users to
    easily write test scripts.&nbsp; Implemented libraries to emulate protocol
    behavior to facilitate large scale testing with minimal hardware and
    computing resources (including writing class browser GUI).
  </li>
  <li>
    Designed/developed testing framework for hardware/software testers
    (including developers writing&nbsp; functional/unit tests) so they can write
    tests for simulated hardware before hardware ASIC is available.
  </li>
  <li>
    Framework allows easy test automation complete with logging and
    reports.&nbsp; This contribution was a significant part in making the tools
    prevalent on the most critical projects in the company; developer
    testimonials indicated that use of this technology resulted in reduction in
    development time by several months.
  </li>
  <li>
    Developed/implemented concept of topology independent testing and
    demonstrated its value through&nbsp; implementation of engine for testing
    core functionality of L2 VLANs including basic L2 flooding, learning,&nbsp;
    end-station moves; this engine formed the basis for almost all VLAN
    regression tests used by software group.
  </li>
  <li>
    Developed distributed Unix Domain Socket; allows applications (like a socket
    based router and switch simulator) to be distributed across multiple
    machines. Distributed UNIX Domain Sockets can be accessed just like their
    non-distributed counterparts allowing network simulations to be distributed
    with almost no changes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Designed/implemented ability to create multiple instances of the test packet
    tool running on different machines so that testers can write more complex
    test cases (e.g., send traffic to a device from more than one direction at a
    time for high performance distributed testing).
